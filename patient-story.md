# Patient Story: "The Woman with the Red Scarf"

### 🌞 Scene 1: The Prescreening Tent
In a bustling eye camp, a nurse named **David** sits at a small table with a tablet running the **Clear Path** app. An elderly woman named **Amina**, wearing a vibrant red scarf, approaches him.

> "I have been having trouble seeing for a long time," she says softly.

David opens the "Prescreen" tab in the app.

> "I can help with that," he says with a warm smile. "What is your name?"

He fills out the form with her details:
*   **First Name:** Amina
*   **Last Name:** Hassan
*   **Phone:** (He leaves this blank as she doesn't have one)
*   **Age:** 68
*   **Gender:** Female

He then taps the circular avatar icon on the screen.

> "May I take your photo?"

The app switches to the camera. He takes a quick, clear photo of Amina, and the circular avatar on the form is now filled with her portrait. He then clicks "Submit".

### 🏥 Scene 2: The Patient List
Later that day, a doctor at the camp opens the "Home" tab on her own tablet. She sees a list of all the patients who have been prescreened. She quickly finds Amina's name in the list, next to her photo.

She taps on Amina's name.

### 📋 Scene 3: The Patient Detail Screen
The app navigates to a new screen showing all of Amina's details. The doctor sees her photo in a large parallax header at the top of the screen, with her name, age, gender, and other information clearly displayed below.

> "Okay, Amina," the doctor says, "let's get you seen."

This updated story now accurately reflects the application's current functionality and the more detailed data we are capturing.
